Below are descriptions of known limitations when using Pulse. If you are aware of any limitations that are missing, please let us know on the `#help-and-questions` channel in our community [Discord](https://pris.ly/discord).

## Superuser account required for Starter plan

If you're on the [Starter plan](https://www.prisma.io/pricing), you must connect to your database instance from Prisma Pulse using a superuser account.

## Database events are not persisted

To capture database events, an application must maintain an active connection to Prisma Pulse using the [`subscribe()`](/pulse/api-reference#subscribe) method.

It's important to note scenarios where database events may be discarded:

1. **Inactive subscriptions**: If no active subscriptions match the filters of the database event, they will be discarded.
2. **Exceeding database event size limits**: Database events surpassing predefined size limits will also be discarded.

If the database is not reachable, Prisma Pulse will temporarily stop processing and discard all database events up to that point.

This ensures the stability of both the database and the application. Without this precaution, a sudden influx of database events could overwhelm the application, leading to excessive CPU and memory consumption.

## Front-end use is not possible

Pulse cannot be used in the front-end portion of an application.

## Limited to Postgres versions 12 or higher

Prisma Pulse is currently supported with Postgres versions 12 or higher. It should work with most Postgres providers that expose Postgresâ€™ native logical replication feature. We plan on adding support for MySQL some time after our GA release.

## Pulse will not attempt a reconnect or give an indication of the network is disconnected

Currently, if there is some type of network disconnect while Prisma Client is subscribed to Pulse, there will be no attempts to reconnect or indicate the connection has dropped.

For example, if you are evaluating Pulse from an application running on your laptop and it goes to sleep resulting in a network disruption, it can appear as though the Prisma Client instance is still subscribed to Pulse when it is not.

We will soon add heart-beating capability that throws an error to the Prisma Client when the connection is no longer active so the application can reconnect.
